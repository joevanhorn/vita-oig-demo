# Okta Privileged Access (OPA) Integration Plan

**Feature:** Okta Privileged Access Terraform Provider Integration
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Started:** 2025-12-14
**Completed:** 2025-12-14
**PR:** [#26](https://github.com/joevanhorn/okta-terraform-demo-template/pull/26)

---

## Overview

### What Was Built

Integration of the `okta/oktapam` Terraform provider as an optional module for managing Okta Privileged Access (OPA) resources alongside the standard Okta provider.

### Why It Was Needed

- OPA is a separate Okta product requiring its own Terraform provider
- Customers with OPA licenses need to manage privileged access resources via GitOps
- Server access, secrets management, and security policies require `oktapam` provider
- Demo environments may need to showcase OPA features

### Key Capabilities Added

- Server access project management
- Server enrollment token automation
- Secret folder and secret storage
- Security policy configuration
- Gateway setup token generation
- Kubernetes cluster access management
- Active Directory integration

---

## Release Summary

### Single-Phase Release (MVP Complete)

Since OPA integration was straightforward and self-contained, it was delivered as a single release rather than multiple phases.

## How to Enable OPA

### Prerequisites

1. Okta Privileged Access license
2. OPA Team configured in Okta
3. Service user with administrator role

### Steps

1. **Create OPA Service User**
   - OPA Console → Settings → Service Users
   - Save key and secret

2. **Add GitHub Secrets**
   - `OKTAPAM_KEY` - Service user key
   - `OKTAPAM_SECRET` - Service user secret
   - `OKTAPAM_TEAM` - Team name

3. **Enable Provider**
   - Uncomment `oktapam` provider in `provider.tf`
   - Uncomment variables in `variables.tf`

4. **Create Resources**
   - Copy from `opa_resources.tf.example`
   - Customize for your environment

---

## Testing Performed

- [x] Terraform format validation (`terraform fmt`)
- [x] Provider block syntax validation
- [x] Example file pattern verification
- [x] Documentation completeness review
- [x] AI-assisted context file validation
- [x] GitHub Actions validation workflow (passed except AWS OIDC - expected)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **security_policy_v2** - Under active development, may have breaking changes
2. **Separate Authentication** - OPA requires its own service user credentials
3. **Optional Feature** - Only enable when OPA license is available
4. **PR Validation** - Full terraform plan requires AWS/Okta credentials

---

## Future Enhancements

### ✅ Completed (Phase 2)

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow for OPA-specific operations (`opa-plan.yml`)
- [x] Import script for existing OPA resources (`import_opa_resources.py`)
- [x] OPA variables tfvars.example file

### Potential Future Additions

- [ ] OPA resource examples in demo scenarios
- [ ] Integration with Okta Workflows for OPA automation
- [ ] Secret rotation workflow
- [ ] Gateway deployment automation
